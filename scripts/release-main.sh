# Release the stable channel from `main` in a single merge.
#
# The former flow took two: changesets opened a "version packages" PR, and only
# merging *that* published. A release could therefore sit one merge short of the
# registry with every check green, which is the failure this removes. The
# pre-release branch already published in one push; now the stable channel does
# too, so neither needs a human between a merge and the registry.
#
# Order matters: publish first, then record. A published version is immutable and
# the dist-tag guard proves it moved; if the commit-back then fails, re-pushing
# the version commit is a safe retry. The reverse order would leave a recorded
# version the registry never received, and the consumed changesets would be gone,
# so nothing would publish it on a retry.
#
# Usage: release-main.sh   (run from a checkout of `main`, with GITHUB_TOKEN set)
