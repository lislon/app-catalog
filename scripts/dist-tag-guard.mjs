/**
 * Release guard: prove that a publish actually MOVED the npm dist-tag.
 *
 * Both publish paths treat "this exact version is already on the registry" as a
 * warning and exit 0 — `changeset publish` by design, and
 * `scripts/publish-oidc.mjs` deliberately, so partial-failure reruns are safe.
 * The consequence is that a release which shipped nothing reports success, while
 * the changeset that triggered it is consumed either way, so the next run has
 * nothing left to publish. That is how the stable channel stayed wedged for days
 * without a single red check.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/dist-tag-guard.mjs capture --tag <tag> --out <file>
 *   node scripts/dist-tag-guard.mjs assert  --before <file> --mode snapshot|release
 *
 * `capture` records, for every publishable package under `packages/`, the
 * version declared in package.json and the version the registry currently
 * serves on <tag>. Run it before the publish step, while package.json still
 * describes what this run intends to ship.
 *
 * `assert` re-reads the registry and fails the job when the publish was a no-op:
 *
 *   --mode snapshot   The pre-release channel. Every push mints a fresh
 *                     timestamped version, so the tag MUST move on every run.
 *                     Requires <tag> to now serve the version currently
 *                     declared in package.json.
 *
 *   --mode release    The stable channel. A push with nothing new to publish is
 *                     legitimate, so the expectation comes from the capture: for
 *                     each package whose captured declared version was not the
 *                     one the registry served, <tag> must now serve it. Packages
 *                     that were already published stay silent.
 *                     The expectation cannot be re-read from the working tree,
 *                     because `changesets/action` rewrites package.json in place
 *                     when it opens a version PR.
 *
 * Reads are retried until a deadline, because a fresh publish takes a few
 * seconds to become visible through npm's CDN. Every individual lookup is also
 * given a hard timeout: `npm view` was measured hanging for 951s on one call out
 * of ten while its neighbours answered in under a second, and an unbounded read
 * would stall the release rather than report on it.
 *
 * Unlike `scripts/check-registry-versions.mjs` this guard is fail-CLOSED: it
 * runs on the publish path, where "cannot tell" must never be reported as
 * "shipped".
